In mathematics, a rose or rhodonea curve is a sinusoid specified by either the cosine or sine functions
with no phase angle that is plotted in polar coordinates. Rose curves or "rhodonea" were named by
the Italian mathematician who studied them, Guido Grandi, between the years 1723 and 1728.


A rose is the set of points in polar coordinates specified by the polar equation

###### r = a * cos( k * theta)

for various rational numbered values of the angular frequency

## k=n/d.

or in Cartesian coordinates using the parametric equations

###### x = r * cos( theta )

###### y = r * sin( theta )

you can change the n and d values to get different patterns
